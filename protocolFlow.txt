chain building on Ethereum 

Have an array of the teams 

map each team to a fixed slot

Users have to send in asset to the contract (deposit + participation fee).
    users should not be able to deposit once the event starts.

A participation fee is charge for every user that choose to join in the event.
    - participation fee will be charge on every deposit.

Users should only join events only after they have made deposit.

Relase funds to successful users at the end of the event 

Have a minimum amount to join the event with. 

users can be able to cancell before the event starts 

we need to know the number of participants and total value in the vault

    Uers Deposit ==> 
        * funds are sent to the contract. 
        * fees are sent to the fee address. 
        * user deposit is updated. 
    
    User JoinEvent ==>
        * user is to pick a valid team.
        * get shears for the asset deposited 
        * users should only join once.
        * map the user to the country they picked 

    User cancellParticipation ==>
        * user is able to get back their funds 
        * users should not be able to join event
        * users will receive funds with deducted fees.

    User redeem
        * only winners should get winning funds 
        * 

    Using Oasis tech
        * Users address and amount will be kept private 


To be worked on 
-- Let the assets be sent to a aave strategy to earn yeilds for the pperiod when the period when the contract will be running.
-- Implement oasis tech on this project to the users address private.  


Build thought problem 
if users win more than the lossers the value of assets might be small to shear among all winning useres. 
if all win depending on the number of users what happen to the funds.
